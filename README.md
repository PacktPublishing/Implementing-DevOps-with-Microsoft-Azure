# Implementing DevOps with Microsoft Azure
This is the code repository for [Implementing DevOps with Microsoft Azure](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/implementing-devops-microsoft-azure?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787127029), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will teach you all about the Visual Studio Team Services and Microsoft Azure PaaS offerings that support Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, and execution in the cloud with high availability, disaster recovery, and security.

You will first be given a tour of all the concepts and tools that Microsoft Azure has to offer and how these can be used in situations to cultivate the DevOps culture. Youâ€™ll be taught how to use and manage Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and about the structure of the sample application used throughout the book. You will become familiar with the nitty gritty of Continuous Integration and Continuous Development with VSTS and Microsoft Azure Apps. You will not only learn how to create App service environments, but also how to compare Azure Web Apps and App Service Environments to deploy web applications in a more secure environment.

Once you have completed Continuous Integration and created the Platform for application deployment, you will learn more about the final stepping stone in achieving end-to-end automation using approval-based Continuous Delivery and Deployment. You will then learn about Continuous Monitoring, using the monitoring and notification options provided by Microsoft Azure and Visual Studio Team Services.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <security>
      <ipSecurity allowUnlisted="true" denyAction="NotFound">
        <add allowed="true" ipAddress="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"      
          subnetMask="255.xxx.xxx.xxx"/>
      </ipSecurity>
    </security>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

This book assumes that you are familiar with at least the Java programming language. Knowledge of core Java and JEE is essential if you want to gain better insights from this book. Having a strong understanding of the deployment of a web application in application servers such as Tomcat will help you to understand the flow quickly.

As the application development life cycle will cover a lot of tools in general, it is essential to have some knowledge of repositories, as well as IDE tools such as Eclipse, and build tools such as Ant and Maven. Knowledge of code analysis tools will make your job easier in configuration and integration; however, it is not vital to perform the exercises given in the book. Most of the configuration steps are mentioned clearly.

You will be walked through the steps required to get familiar with VSTS, Microsoft Azure Web Apps, Microsoft Azure App Service Environments, and Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

For Microsoft Azure, you can use a one month trial access. VSTS also comes with a trial account with some restrictions.
